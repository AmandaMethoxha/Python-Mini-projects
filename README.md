# Python Mini Projects

A tidy collection of small Python console apps. Each project lives in `/projects/<name>` with its own README and run instructions.

## Projects

  `projects/math-quiz/`
- **MadLib Generator** — fill placeholders in `story.txt`  
  `projects/madlib-generator/`
- **Number Guesser** — guess the number with attempt counter  
  `projects/number-guesser/`
- **Pig Game** — 2–4 player dice game, first to 50 wins  
  `projects/pig-game/`
- **Quiz Game** — quick computer-parts quiz  
  `projects/quiz-game/`

## How to run any project
```bash
cd projects/<project-name>
python3 <main-file>.py

## Requirements
Python 3.8+ (no external deps for these CLI projects).
